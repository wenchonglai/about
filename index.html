          <h4>Software Engineering</h4>
          <p>As a software engineer, I employ data structure and algorithms in parsing geographic information systems (GIS) spatial data, leverage computer programming languages to automate workflow, and deploy my JavaScript, React, as well as back-end skills in developing numerous interactive maps and other web-based community planning toolkits that benefit the broad public.</p>

          <h4>Urban Planning & Design</h4>
          <p>As an urban designer, I accumulate critical thinking and quantitative analysis skills, get inspired for creative IT solutions to urban issues, and implement innovative ideas though day-to-day practices in legal documents reading, site planning, design feasibility studies, design standards drafting, as well as collaboration with diverse team and community members.</p>

        <h2>Make story-telling interactive maps.</h2>
        <p>Since 2013, I have started making web applications for interactive maps using JavaScript, jQuery, SVG, Canvas, and React. Compared to the static maps that planners conventionally produce, these interactive maps were much more powerful in conveying comprehensive, informative, and personalized messages tailored to each and every individual amongst thousands of recipients. These interactive maps were also proven to be more cost-efficient, as the web-based approach eliminates the countless redraws incurred during design iterations.</p>

      <h2>Maps are fun. Play with them!</h2>
      <p>Map-based video games such as SimCity and Civilization always fascinate me. Recently, I started developing my own strategic board game. My ultimate goal is to create a turn-based game that incorporates a geographic information system and cellular automata in order to adequately addresses how geography affects economy system and logistics. </p>

      <h2>Boost up design productivity through IT.</h2>
      <p>I write codes that automates repetitive architecture design processes. After joining JKA, I brought down the time spent in 3D base mapping and building cost estimation by over 90%. Full-stack software engineering training in App Academy further prepared me for develop the back-end of office productivity tools using modern application frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and MERN.</p>

      <p>Since the first line of JavaScript I wrote in 2013, I have been continuously learning new languages, libraries, frameworks, as well as advanced data structures and algorithm in order to keep up with the advancing technologies that may bring positive changes to city life. Long journey as it is, I am taking solid steps day by day towards future goals.</p>
